# alliance-os

End of 1999. 

A couple of young and not-so-young nerds has envisioned a world where microkernels where the way to go.
For several months during spare time Alliance OS was engineered in a fully modularized fashion using what in the time was "a la page".
The OS was never finished, but some ideas still lingers today here and there.
There is an almost bootable kernel, a dynamic linker, several experimental stuff.

This archive contains the almost latest tree of Alliance OS, rescued from my personal archive and uploaded here mainly for historical reason. 
Remember: the future always depends from the past, in a way or another.
Looking now "ancient" code tells us a lot of our current trends, for what they are in the positive and the negative way.
Happy surfing.
