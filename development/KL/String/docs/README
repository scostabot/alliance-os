Alliance String Library

This is the first build of Alliance Extension Kernel String Library.
All functions defined in this module can be called by the CK or any
AKs.
These functions are directly derived from standard C library equivalents:

Alliance functions        Standard C library equivalent

StringAppend              strcat
StringCopy                strcpy
StringNumCopy             strncmp
StringCompare             strcmp
StringMatch               strstr
StringLength              strlen
StringCompareNoCase       strcasecmp

I have deliberatly chosen the generic implementation of these functions,
in order to avoid any hardware-dependency problem.
Later, we can optimize for speed using inline assembly, but now the focus
is on function presence instead of performance.
