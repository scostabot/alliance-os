<h3>
<a NAME="Abstract"></a>1. Abstract</h3>
This document tries to specify in a detailed way the implementation of
an IOSK Loadable Module.
<h3>
<a NAME="Intro"></a>2. Introduction</h3>
Since this is the first effort in order to implement an LM, and LMs are
inherently unspecified, or better dependant on the SK that use them, I
expect that this document will be useful to other SKs as well, in particular
NetSK that have very similar functional requirements. In any case, analizing
a "real" implementation can give useful hints to other different SKs as
well. This document add more data to existing LM specification document,
and gives here only the new things. It is obvious that any LM must be compliant
to LM specification document, and that an IOSK LM in particular must be
compliant to this document as well.
<h3>
<a NAME="LM Init"></a>3. LM Init</h3>
When LM code is loaded into memory, LMInit() function is called. Inside
this function is done all one-time-in-the-life kind of stuff for LM. If
it is a device LM, it is required that LMInit() does NOT access hardware.
IOSK gives as parameter the address of a callback routine, that the LM
may call if its internal state has changed and that change is important
to IOSK behaviour (see the paragraph What happens if an LM change state?).
The IOSK also gives the entry point of another function, the one that must
be called if the LM has some data to be put on the preceding LM in the
chain or IOSK itself (see IOSK read interface).
<br>The prototype of the function is:
<p>typedef struct {
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STRING *(*LMProbe)(VOID);
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BOOLEAN (*LMRead)(VOID *, UWORD32);
<br>}LMinitData;
<p>BOOLEAN LMinit(LMinitData *)
<p>IOSK tell the loaded LM which is the callback to use when data is available
to IOSK, and which function call when LM changes its internal cnfiguration
(see <a href="#Read interface">LM Read interface </a>and <a href="#LM Probing">LM
Probing</a>).
<br>Note that on LM specification document, the LMDescrption structure
has two fields, <b>canRead</b> and <b>canWrite</b>. These fields are still
valid, but only as a default state, i.e., immediately after the LM is loaded.
After the IOSK has interrogated LM on his actual capalities with LMProbe(),
these fields must be ignored.
<h3>
<a NAME="LM Probing"></a>4. LM Probing</h3>
Since IOSK LMs implements a wide range of different functions, ranging
from caches ending to serial port drivers, a standard mechanism to identify
what an LM can do is essential for IOSK (or any SK as well). In order to
be generic enough to cover all possible situations, present and future,
when IOSK want to know if a loaded LM can work and if so, what can do,
IOSK interrogate the LM calling a probing function:
<p>STRING * LMprobe(VOID)
<p>The LM returns a string that contains the LM capabilities, using a specific
syntax. Considering a practical example, let's see the serial port on a
IBM PC. In a PC compatible up to four serial ports may be present. The
registers to control them are contained in a location written by BIOS at
0:0400h. In my system is 0000:0400 F8 03 F8 02 00 00 00 00 That is, two
serial ports with regs at 0x3f8 (COM1:) and 0x2f8 (COM2:). When the IOSK
wants to know which and how many different configuration the LM just loaded
supports, calls the LMProbe function defined in LM code. The LMProbe function
reads memory at 0x400 and returns a string to IOSK formatted this way:
<p><tt>"LMSerial(0, 1200 | 2400 | 9600 | 19200=Speed)=RW\nLMSerial(1, 1200
| 2400 | 9600 | 19200=Speed)=RW"</tt>
<p>That reads, from left to right "LMSerial instance 0 defines a control
function called Speed that accepts the strings 1200, 2400, 9600 or 19200
as input, and on that instance supports I/O operations". Same for the second
line for instance 1. The outermost equal sign identify the LM I/O function
present. Some devices are read-only, like CDs, some are both readable and
writable. This field tells which is which, and from this the IOSK can know
if routines LMRead and LMWrite are present or not (see Read interface and
Write interface paragraphs). This mini language defines roughly the equivalent
of Unix ioctl(), with the advantage that we don't need to know in advance
which functions can be called into the module, since the module itself
tell us so.
<br>Probing is also essential to support a user-friendly installation program,
since we can configure on the fly an Alliance OS machine. In order to be
really useful, the names of interface functions defined in this way must
be standardized. Doing so, a program that transfers files over a serial/parallel
port can work with all kind of ports without being modified, if the semantic
of such names does not change from LM to LM. We can say that LMProbe defines
the control interface of LM, i.e. defines a series of function entry points
and relative allowable parameters.
<br>It is important to note that the syntax defines only the relationship
entry points-parameters, and does not define or enforce any semantical
meaning to the data. The semantical level interpretation is left uniquely
to IOSK, that convetionally will enforce a standard naming. For instance,
all serial port interface must contain serial in the name given by LMProbe.
The syntax allows definitions of ranges:
<p><tt>"LMSound(0, 0-255=Volume, 0-255=Tone, 0-255=Balance)=RW"</tt>
<p>for instance defines the string given out by LMProbe by the LM that
supports a sound card. The LM supports three control functions, named Volume,
Tone and Balance, that accepts a number from 0 to 255 inclusive. Ranges
may applied to instances as well, but in this case the IOSK must check
if the different instance definition wraps each other:
<p><tt>"LMDSP(0-15, 0-1000#.1=SampleSpeed)=RW\nLMDSP(16-23, 0-1=SwitchState)=RO"</tt>
<p>in this case IOSK ensures that the deltas given in the two instance
groups (0-15 and 16-23) does not overlap. If they overlap, the LM is unloaded.
The '#' symbol defines the step of the increment, so in this case you can
set the speed of the DSP board instance 5 at 150.5, or set instance 1 at
1000, or whatever. The complete definition of the LM probing grammar is
defined in Appendix A.
<h3>
<a NAME="Change state"></a>5. What happens if an LM change state?</h3>
Configurations can change over time during the lifetime of an LM, so a
mechanism to notify changes to IOSK must be provided. IOSK defines a callback
function that serves such requests incoming from a generic LM. Since it
is IOSK at LM init time that gives the address of the callback function,
it can be different for each loaded LM, if necessary. For instance, IOSK
also support removable media like CD-ROMs, and you can insert anytime a
CD into the drive.Only the device LMIDE can know this, so calls the callback
function and gives as argument a string formatted with the same language
as LMProbe(). Two cases are possible: the LM has already available all
data related to its new internal configuration and gives all data to IOSK,
or ask IOSK to probe for new hardware again. Considering the above example
<p>LMProbe before disc insertion
<br><tt>LMIDE(0, Open | Close | Lock=DriveDoor)=Inactive</tt>
<p>String given to callback function after disc insertion
<br><tt>LMIDE(0, Open | Close | Lock=DriveDoor)=RO</tt>
<p>Before a disc is inserted in the CDROM, we can only open, close or lock
the tray, but we cannot do any I/O (the Inactive string). After a disc
is inserted, LMIDE notifies IOSK that can do reads, but not writes on the
instance in addition to operation on DriveDoor.
<h3>
<a NAME="IOSK-LM"></a>6. IOSK-LMs communication</h3>
IOSK and LMs communicates through a queue. This is needed due to the asynchronous
nature of I/O operations, which performance falls in synchronous operations.
LMs however simply defines entry points that accepts a pointer and a size
field. It is IOSK that mantains the queues, LMs are totally unaware of
the communication protocol used by IOSK to mantain the LM chain. In each
packet sent over the queue must be present a field that identify to which
instance the packet must be sent to, if and only if the LM has more than
one instance. IOSK knows after LMProbe() if the given LM has one or more
instance available, and if so prepend the instance id prior I/O real data.
The LM itself of course knows this, and interpretes data accordingly.
<h3>
<a NAME="LM Write int"></a>6.1. LM write interface</h3>
BOOLEAN LMwrite(VOID *Buffer, UWORD32 Size)
<p>IOSK tells LM that some data must be processed. If and only if the target
LM has more than one instance, the first sizeof(DATA) bits tells which
instance must process given data.
<h3>
<a NAME="Read interface"></a>6.2. LM read interface</h3>
BOOLEAN LMread(VOID *Buffer, UWORD32 Size)
<p>The address of LMRead is given by IOSK to LM through LMInit(). The LM
when has data available, call this function to pass data to uper element
in the chain or IOSK. Notes on communication It is IOSK that defines the
policy for message passing in the queue, that is, if message data is physically
copied for each packet in another memory packet then given to LM, or if
mantains only one buffer regardless of how many LMs in the chain will process
the same packet.
<h3>
<a NAME="LM implementors"></a>7. LMs from the implementor point of view</h3>
The LM model for IOSK is functional to cover in the most complete and efficient
way the constantly changing environment in both HW peripherals and SW update.
In order to maximize code reuse, flexibility in user configuration (new
LMs may be dynamically added and remove if a special need is requested)
LMs are required to be as functioanally as atomic as possible. It is both
complex (even possible) to implement an LM that act as a serial port driver
and SCSI controller, but totally useless, wasteful and inefficient. Do
one thing, and do it good.
