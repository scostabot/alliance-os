<h2>Alliance NetSK working diagrams proposal:</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
While the NetSK objectives are being discussed, it seems to be evident that the relationships with other SKs are very important.
<BR>
The first SK that I want to talk about is the IOSK, as it will handle a big part of the networking job: transmiting and receiving data thru devices.
<P>
<b>The NetSK - IOSK interaction:</b><BR>

Here, in the first image, we can see a general diagram which shows an application that wants to send some data.<BR>
The application has to request the operation to the NetSK, which in turn relays in the IOSK to send the data to the selected media.
<BR>

<P>
Ok, let´s see more precisely what happens.<BR>
In this figure we can see the IOSK. This SK is responsible to handle all I/O in the AllianceOS, and thus should handle all the communication device drivers.<BR>

<P>
The device driver should:<BR>
	- Configure the device if necesarry<BR>
	- transmit data<BR>
	- Receive data through forcing an interrupt<BR>
The data is handled by the IOSK in input and output operations.
<P>
For a transmission, the NetSK passes the data to the IOSK and the IOSK should then send it.<BR>
For a reception, the IOSK takes the data and passes it to the NetSK as soon as possible.<BR>

<P>
This, while maintaining the modularity of the system, increases the system load because of the intervention of the IOSK. Suggestions for this are needed.
<P>
The incoming data, when passed to the NetSK comes into the pertinent family packet manager. This manager will then demux the packet to the appropriate protocol.<BR>

<P>
Here are some little ideas which may sound very obvious (I feel a little stupid with this topic :-)).<BR>
Comments are expected.
