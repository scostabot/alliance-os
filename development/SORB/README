After compilation you will get (in the binaries directory):
	Client			An executable that performs requests on the
				Echo object
	libEcho-stub.so 	A DLL containing the stub functions for the 
				Echo object
	libORB.so		A DLL containing some of the ORB functions
	libEcho.so		Echo implementation (CORBA aware) as a DLL
	libEcho-na.so		Echo implementation (not CORBA aware) as a DLL
	Echo-Server		Echo threaded implementation (containing the
				Object Server and the Object adapter)

Client support the following command line options (NYI):
	calls N			Perform N requests on the Echo object
	library			Use the library implementation (default)
	thread			use the threaded implementation
	not_aware		use a non corba aware implementation

Default options are
	Client calls 10000 library
