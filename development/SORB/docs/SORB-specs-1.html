<A NAME="Intro"></A>Introduction</H2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This document will set the guidelines that will be used
for coding the System ORB. This includes defining the complete route of
the requests peformed by the clients, as well as specifying the way responses
go back to the caller. Note that this can involve using IPC methods. This
paper will not discuss how IPC must be implemented, not which part of the
system should implement it. IPC has, anyway, to be present for the SORB
to work.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also is the purpose of this document to define the
shape that CORBA components will take, and how are they integrated into
a compiled binary.

<A NAME="Goals"></A>Goals</H2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objective of the System ORB is to act as an interface
between the diferent Alliance Kernel objects, allowing them to be distributed,
or to be managed from a remote machine. This functionality is to be achieved
by adopting OMG CORBA as the backbone of the communication in the Alliance
core system. This aproach will also benefict the development of distributed
aplications, as the CORBA functionality is also provided to the applications
running on top of an Alliance system in a transparent but limited way (by
using the <I>dual syntax</I>) or in a explicit and complete way (by using
the IDL language mappings provided)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The System ORB must be optimized and be as fast as
possible in order to make the whole system fast. This will lead sometimes
to developping native protocols and reduce the number of calls. When this
optimizations lead to uncompabiilities with the CORBA specification, a
paralell CORBA compliant method or some CORBA compliant wrappers must be
provided.

<A NAME="Guidelines"></A>Alliance Coding Guidelines</H2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the CORBA specification sets the function names for
the IDL defined function, and the Alliance Kernel has its own coding guidelines,
which specify a format for naming C language structures (functions, types,
variables...) a compromise must be taken between both.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This compromise means using the CORBA languaje mapping
when applicable (when writing an implementation or when calling them, as
well as in the generated stubs and skeletons), and follow the Alliance
Coding Guidelines in any other case.

<A NAME="CORBA components"></A>Implementation of CORBA components</H2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it would be a good thing to base the SORB completely
in existing ORBs, it seems like we are not gooing to be able to do so.
Flick<SUP><A HREF="#Flick">(1)</A></SUP>(used for the Flux kernel<SUP><A HREF="#Flux">(2)</A></SUP>)
has an IDL compiler that seems to generate the most optimized stubs, but
it only provides GNU license to the IDL compiler, while the accompaning
library is under a modified verion of the BSD license. Also, it is only
CORBA 2.0 compliant.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the other hand, ORBit<SUP><A HREF="#ORBit">(3)</A></SUP>
(part of the Gnome project) is fully under GNU license, and CORBA 2.2 compliant,
so we can use it to "fill the gaps". Anyway, the compatibility between
both ORBs has not been checked, and will probably be very low (as the inners
of each ORB are not defined in the CORBA specs), so here are some guidelines
to follow when developping our own CORBA components.
<DIV ALIGN=right><A HREF="#Top">[Top]</A></DIV>

<H3>

<HR ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="40%"><BR>
<A NAME="IDL Compiler"></A>IDL compiler</H3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very possible that we end using the Flick IDL
compiler. This compiler generates very optimized stubs but still requires
an ORB library (called the ORB Run-time library) to link against.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IDL compiler will generate function namesacording
to the Alliance coding guidelines in addition to those according to the
CORBA language mappings. For a description about how this will be done,
read above the section "<A HREF="#Guidelines">Alliance Coding Guidelines</A>"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An additional tool must be designed to compile the
generated files and to register them so they are available to other CORBA
applications.
<BR>&nbsp;
<DIV ALIGN=right><A HREF="#Top">[Top]</A></DIV>

<H3>

<HR ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="90%"><BR>
<A NAME="Subs"></A>Stubs</H3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stubs are dessigned for eficiency. They should be able
to build and deliver the requests at the fastest speed, as the overall
system performance depends on this. To allow transparent use of new versions
of objects (without recompiling the whole client application) stubs will
be compiled as dynamic link libraries.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The executuon of the stubs will be the following:
<OL>
<LI>
Find the object information stored in the IR. The stub should return an
error if the object can not be found. Optionally, a validation of the types
and number of the arguments can be done (this validation will always be
succesful, unless an uncomplete installation of a new version has been
done). This check could also be substituted by including version information
in the IDL definition by using the <B>#pragma <I>&lt;name> &lt;major>.&lt;minor></I></B>
directive.</LI>

<BR>This operation will be implemented in the run-time ORB library, and
will only be called once for a given object, meaning that the results are
cached inside the llibrary. A entrypoint must exist in the comiled stub
for updating the object info (using this entrypoint will require using
some external program, probably the same that performs the install/uninstall
process). Note that storing this info, and the posibility that it might
change will require some concurrency control. The classic solution for
the readers&amp;writers problem (with priority for writers) could be applied
here.
<LI>
Determine if the object is local or remote. This can be known from the
Object Reference. A possible format could be</LI>

<BR><TT><NOBR>struct IOR {</NOBR></TT>
<BR><TT><NOBR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BOOLEAN local;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* the implementation
is in the local machine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*/</NOBR></TT>
<BR><TT><NOBR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BYTE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ip[4];&nbsp;&nbsp;
/* IP address of the machine that can process the request */</NOBR></TT>
<BR><TT><NOBR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CORBA_Scoped_Name sn;&nbsp; /* Scoped
name of the object in the IR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*/</NOBR></TT>
<BR><TT><NOBR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BYTE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flags;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/* 0x1 set if the target ORB is a SORB</NOBR></TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
* 0x2 set if the implementation is known to be a library</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
* 0x4 set if the implementation is CORBA aware */</TT>
<BR><TT><NOBR>};</NOBR></TT>
<BR>The first field will determine whether to use TCP or a local memory-based
IPC method for delivering the request. If the request is locally served,
the <I>url</I> field is not checked, so it needs not to be filled when
reading the structure (this will give us some nanoseconds more :-). The
<I>sn</I> field will give us the hability to perform a quick lookup in
the IR and build a list of methods provided by the object by using:
<BR><TT><NOBR>/* "ir" is our interface repository object</NOBR></TT>
<BR><TT><NOBR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "sn" is the scoped name for the object we want,
obtained from the IOR */</NOBR></TT>
<BR><TT><NOBR>CORBA_Contained&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface;</NOBR></TT>
<BR><TT><NOBR>CORBA_ContainedSeq methods;</NOBR></TT>

<P><TT><NOBR>interface = CORBA_lookup(ir, sn, &amp;environment);</NOBR></TT>
<BR><TT><NOBR>methods = CORBA_contents (interface, CORBA_dk_Operation,
CORBA_False, &amp;environment);</NOBR></TT>

<P>Now we have all the method descriptors (other IR objects) for the methohds
provided by the object in <I>methods</I> which is a CORBA sequence.
<BR>This can be changed to use SORB-specific functions (instead of <I>CORBA_lookup</I>
and <I>CORBA_contents</I>) for greater performance (returning a C structure
defining the function we want, instead of a CORBA sequence), while keeping
the CORBA compliant ones for use of applications.
<LI>
Build the request. This will be done using a "flat image" with all the
parameters optimally (32 bit) alligned. In the first possition of this
image there will be stored the index number of the function being called
(in the order returned by the IR). Note that this can also be obtained
once and used many times (having some concurrency control, like above).
When possible (no variable length parameters, like strings, are used) the
memry for this flat image should be allocated once and reused. For variable
length types some reallocations can be avoided by using a (pre-allocated)
bigger buffer when this does not increases the transmission of the message
in a significant ammount of time.</LI>

<LI>
Deliver the request. If local, send the "flat image" containing the request
by IPC, if remote, send it using the NetSK over TCP (using IIOP if <I>isSORB</I>
is false). The functions needed for sending the request will be on the
run-time library.</LI>
</OL>

<A NAME="ORB"></A>ORB</H3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ORB will not exist as an idependent piece of code.
Instead, the ORB functionality will be shared by stubs, a run time library
and the skeletons, allowing greater optimization. Note that, as every Alliance
executable will be linked to some stubs (those of the SKs and CK, at least),
every executable can access every CORBA standarized ORB function, so we
will still provide a fully compliant CORBA 2.2 implementation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other frequently used CORBA interfaces (in addition
to the ORB one) will also be included in this library, like the set of
interfaces required for the Interface Repository. Less frequent interfaces
(like the Dynamic Invocation one) can be provided as a separate library.
