Disclaimer</H2>

<UL>This document is the result of a first (and not too deep) read to the
CORBA specs, focussed in those parts of interest to the System ORB, so
many of this info could be not accurated. I strongly encourage anyone to
find mistakes on this document.</UL>
<A NAME="Objectives"></A>
<H2>
Objectives</H2>

<UL>The main objective of the system ORB is provide a simple and secure
way of accessing the Alliance core (SKs and CK) functions, leaving the
programmer of the task of checking if they are present in a local or remote
machine, if they are loaded or not and other tasks not related with the
program itself.

<P>As a side effect of this approach, we were very close to the CORBA design,
so we incorporated it on our design. This provides a second objective,
that is providing access to any "object" in the system (you can think a
object as a group of similar functions, an executable, a library...), even
if it is not a local one. For that, the CORBA specs provide quite detailed
information (3000+ pages for the full CORBA, CORBAservices and CORBAfacilities
specs).

<P>As a CORBA compliant ORB, the System ORB (or SORB, for short) will need
to maintain a database of installed objects, so, to a certain extent, it
acts as a system configuration manager. The third objective of the System
ORB is to provide full support for the system configuration tasks (keep
track of unnused and repeated DLLs, for example).
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
<A NAME="Dual Syntax"></A>
<H2>
Dual Syntax</H2>

<UL>CORBA compliance implies the use of the CORBA languaje mappings. This
results in a lot of lines to perform simple OS calls. The benefits of that
are small:
<UL>
<LI>
Portability: The same code will run in any other CORBA system which has
an implementation for the methods. This is usefull for writing thin clients
for Alliance. With just an ORB installed this low performance machines
(like i286) can contact the server's SORB and access all Alliance functions
(that are executed in the server).</LI>

<LI>
Network Transparency: Using the CORBA IDL mapping allows the use of the
ORB to locate the object implementation in any networked machine. But...
can't we accomplish the same by encapsulating all the CORBA related sentences
in a more simple one? Sure we could, and it would be friendlier to the
programer (take a look at the C languaje mapping in the CORBA specs, chapter
19, I think, and you will agree with me)</LI>
</UL>
So, what I'm suggesting here is a library with the "usual" names for functions
that will hide all the CORBA related stuff (object initialitation and the
like) for the system well-known objects (CK, SKs and, perhaps, even LMs).

<P>This library will not forbid the use of the normal use of the languaje
mappings, so what we get here is a "dual syntax"... you get the same actions
performed but you can write it in two diferent ways.

<P>Another benefit of this, is that people that are not versed in CORBA
or that do not want to code a distributed application can forget that Alliance
is CORBA based and write their programs as they always did.</UL>
<A NAME="Corba Support"></A>
<H2>
Corba Support</H2>

<UL>This will be, by far, the most complicated part of the System ORB,
and the most important.</UL>
<A NAME="FGNF"></A>
<H3>
The "Alliance Global Naming Service"</H3>

<UL>The CORBAservices specification defines the CORBA Naming service that
allows to search for an specific object by name and location. This is very
useful, but supposes that every ORB in the networked environment will have
information of the objects provided by other machines. That is, if I want
to make a call to the GrSK, first I have to find it in my local Naming
Service that will point me to the correct location of the object. If the
object is in a networked machine, my orb and its will communicate via the
IIOP (Internet InterOrb Protocol) when I send the call.

<P>The problem I see here is that it is almost impossible to have a Naming
service with information on all the objects available trough the internet
(but it could work well on more stable environments, like enterprises,
even big ones). That's why I suggest this "Alliance Global Naming Service".

<P>In fact, this is not a new service, just a little change on the way
it works (or at least, on the way it seems to me it works :). This change
means that the local naming service (and so, the local Interface Repository)
only knows about locally installed objects (which are always updated) and
when an object is not found, it is searched in a user defined (or automatically
generated by sending a broadcast message asking for compatible ORBs) list
of naming services across the network until it is found. Note that, for
WAN (and hopefully LAN), the delay on the first search will be almost unnoticeable,
as the network communication will be the responsable of the most important
part of the delay.

<P>Now there are some ideas that have to be specified in this topic...
for xample, if a remote naming service can point us to search in a different
one (that is, our list of naming services point to www.allos.org, and
www.allos.org points to namingservice.allos.org), or if only those
specified in the local configuration file will be scanned. The first approach
will be more powerful, but probably less eficient, as we should have our
list ordered with the most commonly used objects at top, and will also
require some checks for loops (local -> Remote A -> Remote B -> local).</UL>
<A NAME="IIOPD"></A>
<H3>
The IIOP Daemon</H3>

<UL>As I have introduced a little earlier, two orbs communicate using the
Internet InterOrb protocol. As it is (mainly) a network protocol, we will
need some help from the NetSK. I think that they could provide the implementation
for the IIOP calls defined in the CORBA specs, but it would be necessary
a Daemon to listen for IIOP requests, so they can be processed. We should
agree in a way of interfacing with it (as well as in a standard port for
it, but that is less important). I must confess that I haven't not deeply
read the GIOP/IIOP/DCE IOP chapters of the CORBA specs, so I will not say
much more :-)</UL>
<A NAME="CORBA and IPC"></A>
<H3>
CORBA and IPC</H3>

<UL>Corba relys on some way of IPC for interfacing with running processes
(for example, delivering a request in a program being executed). That way
should be one of the system standard IPC ways. I have some suggestions,
but have not analised them, so I don't know which one is better. I would
apprecite some input here.
<OL>
<LI>
Direct Call: This is the first IPC method that comes to my mind, and that
ELF and dynamic linker makes more easy. Executables can be linked with
a special flag (I'm talking about the linux environment, I belive that
we will be at least as good as them) that allows the dynamic linker to
(dinamically) link other executables to them as if it was a library. This,
joint with some well defined entry points, will allow fast and reliable
IPC just by knowing the name of the executable.</LI>

<LI>
Page swapping: This has been discussed in the Kernel List and has been
suggested by the CK people. It consists in swapping memory pagges from
the sender to the receiver of the message. This will allow the sender to
deliver messages very fast, but the received messages have to be queued
until the receiver processes them (allowing the message handling function
to get some CPU each time a message arrives will solve this, butcan slow
down normal execution...)</LI>

<LI>
Use CORBA for passing remote messages (1 or 2 for local IPC). As CORBA
messages are requests, there is a standard way of passing them (IIOP) to
the target machine (and ORB), which them delivers the message as appropiated.
But... can this be enhanded to deliver ANY kind of messages?</LI>

<LI>
MPI: This has been considered and dropped.</LI>

<A NAME="Languaje Mappings"></A>
<H3>
About the Languaje Mappings</H3>

<UL>Well, these are only some thought I had while browsing the C languaje
mapping (CORBA specs, chapter 19) and reviewing some code (ORBacus, OmniORB)
using the C++ languaje mapping.

<P>Fists, the C languaje does not support objects, and CORBA is an object
based architecture, so the weird things that need to be done to code in
C for CORBA are quite ammusing (I still don't know how properties are stored...).
In exchange, the languaje mappings (or at least the code needed for using
an object) for object oriented languajes like C++ are easier to understand
and almost straigtforward from the IDL definition. Also, skeletons and
implementations (also interfaces?) maintain a relationship based on inheritance,
which makes it very easy to write the implementations (at least compared
to the C mapping).

<P>That's why I suggest to develop first the C++ languaje mapping and when
it is finally working try to set up the C one.</UL>
<A NAME="IDL Compiler"></A>
<H3>
The IDL Compiler</H3>

<UL>Also, we will need to code some IDL compilers (for C, C++, Smalltalk,
Java...), one for each languaje mapping we are going to support (and we
must support them all, because we don't want to limit the number of programming
languajes that will run on top of Alliance OS).

<P>I think that I will start asking for help for doing so (after all, the
specifications are wrote... at least the public part).

<P>We also need to know how our internal representation will be, so the
IDL compiler can create the stubs and the types for the implementation.</UL>

<H2>
<A NAME="Resources"></A>Resources</H2>

<UL>ORBacus:&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.ooc.com/ob.html">http://www.ooc.com/ob.html</A>
. This has some good examples about how to use CORBA from a programming
languaje. I just downloaded the documentation (in Portable Document Format,
.pdf, you will need Acorbat Reader), but there is also the free source.
This is the most advanced Free ORB implemetation I've seen (even when it
implements BOA still).

<P>The OMG pages: <A HREF="http://www.omg.org">http://www.omg.org</A> .
Here you can get the CORBA , CORBAservices and CORBAfacilities specifications.

<P>ORBit:&nbsp; <A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/ORBit/ORBit-0.2.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/ORBit/ORBit-0.2.tar.gz</A>
. Bad documented and still in work in progress, but is the only GPLed ORB
compliant with CORBA 2.2 we have found. It is more than probable that this
becomes the start point for the System ORB.

<P>MPI (Message Passing Interface):&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.netlib.org/utk/papers/mpi-book/mpi-book.html">http://www.netlib.org/utk/papers/mpi-book/mpi-book.html</A>
. I don't think this would be of any use, but without looking at it you
can't tell.

<P>You can get a lot more of links from the message "links, links, links"
posted by Jean Queralt, and a previous one posted by Daniel Arbuckle pointing
to 2 more free source ORBs (for getting one of those you must have CVS
tools installed)
