1. #include "file.idl" directives in idl files.
	Acording to the CORBA 2.2 specification, these directives are mapped
in C to #include "file.h" in the generated header file, but as libIDL uses a
prepocessor prior to parsing the idl file, we can't know when a #include was
in the original idl file. This forces to protect every declaration in the
generated file:
#ifndef _scope_of_symbol_symbolname
#define _scope_of_symbol_symbolname
	/* Symbol definition goes here */
#endif
#ifndef _scope_of_other_symbol_anothername
...

2.- #pragmas are preprocessed.
	As in the above case, we loose all the information on the #pragma
directives becouse of libIDL preprocessing.
