freedom to the ORB implementation.

* Location of the release flag for the sequence type in the C mapping
	The _release field is added to the mapping for sequences so we have:
	IDL:
	  typedef sequence<long,10> vec10;

	C Mapping:
	  typedef struct {
	    CORBA_unsigned_long _maximum;
	    CORBA_unsigned_long _length;
	    CORBA_long *_buffer;
	    UBYTE _release : 1; /* 1-bit release flag */
	  } vec10;
