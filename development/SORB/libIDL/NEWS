* Status as of 8/17/98

** Just about everything is working now, except for a few small
ambiguity cases which may not get detected, but should be easily
avoidable anyway.  The changeover to using glib is there, and hash
tables are used extensively now so that the O order has been reduced.

Repository IDs are also generate properly now, along with the three
pragams, and there is also a declaration spec which can tag certain
interfaces to not generate tree data.  Error messages have also been
improved significantly.

The docs are out of date and need revamping.


* Status as of 7/18/98

** Most needed features are working to read CORBA v2.2 IDL.  See the
file BUGS to see what else needs to be done; at this point things like
speed are low priority, however a changeover to using glib and more
efficient data structures like sorted heaps or hashes might be in
order down the line.  I'm not sure how useful libIDL might be apart
from its use in an IDL compiler, but the docs still need work.
