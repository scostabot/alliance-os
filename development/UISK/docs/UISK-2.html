    <h1>User Interface System Kernel</h1><br>
  </center>

  <h2>General</h2>
  &nbsp&nbsp The UISK implements those parts of a user interface system that
  are shared between all or most user interfaces, and it implements
  functionality which allows a single user to use multiple user interfaces
  simultaneously and seamlessly.<p>

  &nbsp&nbsp The UISK has several distinct parts: Event queues, clipboards,
  renting out screen space, global atoms. It does <strong>not</strong>
  ever actually touch the screen, but it allows the various user interfaces
  to decide when to do so. It does <strong>not</strong> act on  events in 
  the qeues, but it makes those queues available to all of the user interfaces 
  currently running. The UISK could also be extended to support such things 
  as mail slots if there is need.<p>

  Note: The GRSK should support drawing with alpha, 
  e.g. putPixel(x, y, red, green, blue, alpha). This will make a lot of very
  cool things available to Alliance programs. Native programs, or programs
  running under an AK that makes use of the feature, could do things like
  have semi-transparent window backgrounds.<p>

  <h2>Specifics</h2><br>
  <h3>Panes</h3><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp Panes are a basic element of the UISK data structures. When
  a section of screen is rented out, a pane is created that represents
  that section of screen. Each pane includes a location, bounding box
  size, a visible flag, and, optionally, a shape which allows
  non-rectangle windows. Shapes are implemented by storing an alpha channel
  for each pane. This alpha channel contains for each pixel of the pane a
  value which indicates transparency, and a bit which flags transparency to
  events. If the bit is set, events occuring at that point will be passed on
  to the pane below. Panes can overlap on the screen, but at any given pixel 
  value only one pane will indicate that it is 'on top'. All others will
  be considered to be 'under' that pane. Each pane also has an associated event 
  queue, which can be accessed via the same handle that allows access to the 
  pane structure. Some events, such as mouse actions, propogate 'down' though
  the panes which are under the point of the action. This propogation is
  controlled by the 'tranparent to events' bit of the panes at that point.<p>

  <h3>Event Queues</h3><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp The event queues allow the exchange of user interface
  information without forcing the source and destination to be within
  the same user interface. Each pane has its own queue, and there is a
  global event queue. Every event will be in at least the global queue,
  and often more. A mouse click on a part of the screen covered by a
  pane will be placed in both the global queue and in the queue for
  that pane. Other events are placed into the appropriate queues in
  a similar manner. It it up to the User Interface watching and managing
  a particular pane to deal with these events, or pass them on to the
  program which is running the window which the pane represents. If the
  space allocated to an event queue(configurable) is used up, the oldest
  events in the queue are removed to free up space for newer events. The
  queues should be set large enough to avoid this occurence under normal
  circumstances.<p>

  <h3>Clipboards</h3>
  &nbsp&nbsp Clipboards are an important part of user interaction with
  a computer. They enable such actions as copy-and-paste, drag-and-drop,
  even some kinds of IPC. Clipboards must be shared across all
  applications, which is why they are part of the UISK.<p>

  <h3>Global Atoms</h3>
  &nbsp&nbsp An atom is like a clipboard, except that all atoms are set to
  a fixed size when thay are created . This makes them faster for dealing with
  simple data than clipboards are. They are not as generally useful as 
  clipboards, but they can be useful for various things, especially IPC.<p>

  <h2>Detailed</h2>
  These are pseudocode definitions of the methods exported by the UISK. If 
  Alliance uses a distributed method calling procedure such as CORBA IIOP, then
  they will be callable across a network(vetoable by the Security SK), which 
  in conjunction with remote callable methods in the Graphics SK will allow 
  distributed display of a GUI, in the spirit of the X Window System.
  A null PANEHANDLE refers to the root of the display. Special
  characteristics of the root are that it is always 100% opaque on both the
  visible and event channels, and that it is always 'below' all other panes.<p>
