- Make sure the ELF entry point is loaded right with its alignment !!
  Right now, we assume entry is page aligned.  It should always have
  the same offset in the virtual as in the physical page.
  Also change the code in the CK to reflect this change !
- In ELF loader, check that each segment > extMemTop
- Make sure page tables are padded correctly if the amount
  of physical memory isn't a multiple of 4MB
