<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>

GRUB is an attempt to produce a bootloader for IBM PC-compatible machines
that has both the capability to be friendly to beginning or
otherwise non-technically
interested users and the flexibility to help experts in diverse
environments.  It is currently most useful for users of at least
one of the various free UNIX-like operating systems, though it can
be used with most any PC operating system.<P>

This project actually started because we wanted to boot the
<A HREF=http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~trent/gnu/hurd/>GNU HURD</A>
operating system on top of
<A HREF=http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/mach4/html/Mach4-proj.html>
Mach4</A> on an IBM PC-compatible system in a manner compliant
with the <A HREF=boot-proposal.html>Multiboot Standard</A>, which
was put together as a general solution to the problem of the different
boot formats and the functionality they need.
I then tried to add support for the extra functionality to the
standard bootloader used for FreeBSD.  The number of things I had to do
to get it all to work multiplied until it was obviously necessary to
start from scratch with something different.<P>

GRUB has evolved a long way from it's beginnings as a multi-module
bootloader.  Several
of the techniques used have no analogue in the rest of the free
software world, and a few are apparently superior to most proprietary OSes
as well.
The documentation here and in the multiboot proposal should be very
useful to prospective OS and bootloader writers for PCs.<P>

The name comes from the acronym, but also from the realization that although
a grub is one of the smaller (and less interesting) critters - barely worthy
of notice - it is nearly ubiquitous and vital to the order of things.<P>

GRUB is currently available under the
<A HREF=COPYING>GNU General Public License</A>.
This should not be an issue for OS developers or users who dislike
the terms of the GPL, as it is a separate package, and will not
have any licensing impact upon their own work or installation.
If it is still an issue,
<A HREF=mailto:erich@uruk.org>send me e-mail</A> and maybe we can
work something out.<P>

The publically available releases are available on my
<A HREF=ftp://ftp.uruk.org/public/grub/>FTP site</A>, and I
believe they will get included in the GNU FTP sites as well.<P>

Here are links to the <A HREF=NEWS>NEWS file</A>,
