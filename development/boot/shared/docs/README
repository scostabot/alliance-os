This directory contains the code that is shared between the different
parts of the Alliance booting system (GRUB, ABL).  This consists mostly of
filesystem and disk code.  Most of this has been extracted from the
original GRUB distribution.

BEWARE:  This code uses arbitrary memory allocation in the lower memory
area, because memory allocation isn't up yet.  Do not use the lower memory
for data storage until this code will not be used anymore !

Symbols required in parent:
  - int print(const char *format, ...);

Symbols exported for usage:
  - int filepos;    This is the file position where read() starts reading
  - int filemax;    This is the maximal file position (file size)

  These calls can be used to read directly from the disk:
  - int rawread(int drive, int sector, int byte_offset, int byte_len, int addr);
  - int devread(int sector, int byte_offset, int byte_len, int addr);

  These calls can be used to open and read files:
  - int open(char *filename);
  - int read(int addr, int len);  If length==-1, read until end of file
  - int dir(char *dirname);       List directory, printing all completions

XXX - Need to thuroughly document all imported and exported symbols
