<A NAME="Abstract"></A>1. Abstract</H2>
The Alliance Operating System Project, hereafter "Alliance" can provide
Multiple operating system emulation, through the Cache Kernel <A HREF="#Ref1">[1]</A>
or CK, and a set of higher level System Kernels or SKs, with their set of Loadable Modules (LMs) which will provide
all necessary hardware calls to Application Level Kernels or AKs.

<A NAME="Intro"></A>2. Introduction</H2>
In this whitepaper, we will attempt to discuss the interaction between
the different Kernels, and describe the base functionality which all levels
of the Alliance project will be based.
<BR>To help you to get an overview of what is stated here, we have included
the diagram showed below, which shows the Alliance kernel organization.
The most basic functions are provided by the leftmost kernels, and kernels
in the same column perform similar tasks.

<A NAME="CK Layer"></A>3. The Cache Kernel Layer</H2>
The Cache Kernel is the root of Alliance and it's based on the Stanford
University Caching Model of Operating System Kernel Functionality <A HREF="#Ref 1">[1]</A>,
but a custom Alliance CK design is on the way. All developers are encouraged
to understand this document in full, as our Cache model is based fully
on this design. Pay special attention to the section on the Cache Kernel
Interface <A HREF="#Ref 2">[2]</A>.

<P>
<div align=right><i><a href="#Top">[Top]</a></i></div>
<HR WIDTH="70%">
<H2>
<A NAME="LMs"></A>4. Loadable Modules [<I>LMs</I>]</H2>
Loadable modules are an important part of the System Kernels, but they
are discussed before them because the LM concept is a more global idea.
The key idea behind LM concept is about implementing a common infrastructure
logically common to all SKs, developing the micro kernel and modular 
design even below SK level. So LMs implements the minimum common functionality 
factor to all SKs, avoiding to add burden to the minimalist architecture of
Alliance OS and simplyfing in the same time the driver developer. 

<P> AKs can also use LMs to enhance their functionality (i.e. support for new
hardware features in existing supported devices, smart peripheral handling...)
thus, it is recommended that AK designers include them in their designs. 

<P>Also note that LMs work as part of a kernel, and not as children of
it or as peers of it. It is a owner-owned relationship.

<P>Loadable modules or LMs will provide a reduction in size for our SKs.
By loading only modules that are needed, as they are needed, we will be
able to provide services to higher level AKs quickly, without a large memory
footprint. Each of the SKs will have available to them a number of LMs,
some of which can be loaded at boot time, others loaded on demand. The
LMs loaded at boot can be a function of User level configuration, allowing
the user to pick and choose services that will be made available more quickly,
thus allowing the user to enhance performance for their specific application
level.

<P>The dynamic loading of LMs will be done by the SK which owns them as
required by applications. This <B>does not</B> mean that applications have
to explicitly ask the SK to load a LM. They just perform a system call
which the appropriate SK will handle and map to one of its LMs. Then, if
that LM is not in memory (it is determined by checking a SK internal table),
it will load it and complete the system call. From that point, the LM will
stay in memory until the user chooses to unload it, either explicitly or
by setting a time-out for unused LMs. Also, a LM can be swapped out from
memory by the system if needed.

<P>LMs' uses will range from huge range of functions. All Device Drivers
will be implemented as LMs. LMs can be designed to be "Plug'n'Play" if
they are hardware related, either at Install time (similar to Windows 95's
search for hardware), or boot time (User configurable). LMs will also provide
extensible security functions (as different password encryption/storing
schemes), different net protocols (TCP/IP for example), different filesystem
support and so on. 

<p>The spefications document that describes features common to all kind of LMs is contained in <a href="../LM/docs/LM-spec.html">Alliance Loadable Modules specification</a>. Features of LM that are specific to the owner SK are pointed by the relative SK specification document.

<div align=right><i><a href="#Top">[Top]</a></i></div>
<HR WIDTH="70%">
<H2>
<A NAME="SK Layer"></A>5. The System Kernel Layer</H2>
This is the last layer a program should need to be able to run under the
Alliance native environment as it contains the implementation of every
system call (but users will need some user interface to do it by themselves).
As a consequence of this, AKs should not be more than translation boxes
that map emulated calls to the Alliance native call.

<P>In order to provide full operating system services to high level Kernels,
and to applications, we will provide a set of System Kernels (SKs). These
SKs will provide direct hardware access to applications, and to higher
level Application Kernels. The SKs will be designed using loadable modules,
as discussed before, and they can be added and removed from a Alliance
system at any time. The SK interface provides no additional functionality
to the SKs, but it is in charge of assuring that every AK call reaches
the right SK. It does this by looking in a database of which SKs are available
on the system, then loading the correct kernel if it is available but not
already loaded, and finally passing on the call.

<P>We will discuss Kernel levels in a parent child peer relationship. i.e.
The Cache Kernel is the parent of all other processes, the System Kernels
are child processes of the Cache Kernel and peers with each other, and
the CK+SK Layers is parent of Application Kernels, which are peers with
each other, and parents of applications, which are peers with each other.
<H3>
<A NAME="SKs"></A>5.1. System Kernels [<I>SKs</I>]</H3>
They will support the functionality of Alliance not supported directly
by the CK, to ensure the "translation box" concept of AKs. The reason of
different SKs is to allow some of them not to be loaded (i.e. you do not
need graphics support when using only a text interface), to be swapped
out if needed, or to be unloaded if unused, making this way a more efficient
use of system memory.
<H4>
<A NAME="IOSK"></A>5.1.1. Input/Output Kernel [<I>IOSK</I>]</H4>
It is the SK in charge of controlling the input/output channels of the
systems in a raw format, making no interpretation of the data. It breaks
down the devices into two categories: char device (as keyboard, mouse or
modem, for example) and block devices (for example, disks). To access the
hardware devices properly, the IOSK will need a set of drivers, which are
implemented as LMs and will be loaded when needed or at users choice. It
will be primarily used by other SKs which need to access some devices to
work (e.g. FSSK, UISK and NetSK). This is one of the SKs that are needed
to be loaded on system start-up, and it will never be unloaded, as it is
always necessary.

<P>A more complete description of IOSK is contained in <a href="../IOSK/docs/IOSK-spec.html">IOSK specification document</a>.
<H4>
<A NAME="FSSK"></A>5.1.2. File System Kernel [<I>FSSK</I>]</H4>
The File System Kernel will provide a Alliance Specific "True" file system,
and will maintain maintain compatibility with other file system types by
providing emulation of other file system calls. So in this respect, if
we will provide a Windows 95 Emulation AK, then we will provide emulation
of all system calls for Fat, VFat, and Fat32, Application Kernels that
will emulate operating systems will be required to provide system calls
to the File System Kernel API, exactly as the operating system which is
being emulated, and the File System Kernel will provide translation to
and from the Emulated file system. Each file system emulation will be provided
as an LM, either dynamically loaded by Child AKs, or at boot time (user
configurable). By providing the service at boot time, you remove load time
from actual application level loading, at the cost of a higher memory footprint.
This is the last required kernel to complete the start-up sequence of the
system, as it will allow access to disk to find where the rest of kernels
are.

<H4><A NAME="SecSK"></A>5.1.3. Security Kernel [<I>SecSK</I>]</H4>
This kernel will group security functions implemented in Alliance. This
functions have to be discussed and detailed, because some of them will
be implemented as a security library (i.e. file permissions or login/password
check), while others will be implemented directly into the kernel (type
rate checking, for example).
<H4>
<A NAME="NetSK"></A>5.1.4. Networking Kernel [<I>NetSK</I>]</H4>
The Networking Kernel will provide protocol level services to all Application
Kernels. The different protocols will be assigned as LMs, and loaded after
initializing network hardware (what can be done either on startup, when
needed or on user request). The IOSK will provide the access to the hardware
needed for communication (Net Cards, Modems, ports...).. To provide an
example of a peering relationship between SKs, we can provide the Example
of a Network File System Driver. In order to properly implement NFS, we
will have to provide an interaction level between the Input/Output Kernel,
the Networking Kernel, and the File System Kernel, at least.
<H4>
<A NAME="GrSK"></A>5.1.5. Graphics Kernel [<I>GrSK</I>]</H4>
This kernel will handle every access to the video memory, even on text
or graphical modes. It will also provide functions to access special features
on video cards (like the ability to draw rectangles, circles...) to improve
their speed, but in no way it will be responsible of any graphical user
interface but higher level AKs, such as the Alliance GUI AK will be required
to perform their video writing functions via this Kernel Interface instead.

<P>As this Kernel will need to provide similar functionality to DirectX,
in that higher level applications have need to pull full screen, direct
hardware access can be granted to an application upon request. LMs should
be provided for all makes of video cards, and provide both soft and hard
access to the video devices on demand.
<H4>
<A NAME="SndSK"></A>5.1.6. Sound Kernel [<I>SndSK</I>]</H4>
Works like the Graphics Kernel, but accessing the different Sound Cards
using its own Modules. This kernel will also provide sound mixing (playing
more than a sound at a time), volume control, and so on.
<H4>
<A NAME="UISK"></A>5.1.7. User Interface Kernel [<I>UISK</I>]</H4>
The UISK will provide the basic functions and non-visible components of
a UI, like a clipboard, event queues (as keystrokes or mouse clicks) and
the ability of launching apps from supported OSes.
<H4>
<A NAME="ASH"></A>5.1.8. Alliance Scripting Host [<I>ASH</I>]</H4>
The ASH is designed to provide scripting facilities to apps of any supported
OS (including, of course Alliance native applications). It also will manage
the processing of initialization scripts (configuration files) of other
kernels.
<H3>
<A NAME="System ORB"></A>System ORB</H3>
This is the front-end of the Alliance system. Every AK will only "see"
this part of the system.
<BR>The System ORB will allow distributed computing on Alliance by using
CORBA<A HREF="#Ref 5">[5]</A> to locate the SKs (so the AKs can access
SKs installed in a remote machine). It will also allow to use any other
object, like aplications or dynamic link libraries in a distributed way,
conforming to the CORBA specification done by the Object Management Group.
The using of CORBA allows for greater modularity (you only need a small
subset of the system, the rest can be used via the network), and comforming
to an standard allows Alliance to interoperate with other OSes and architectures
with software comforming to the same standard.
<BR>As part of its work, the System ORB will perform the initialization
of the SKs the first time they are loaded in memory, and reload them if
necessary.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="70%">
<H2>
<A NAME="AK Layer"></A>6. The Application Kernel Layer</H2>
Application Kernels will provide multiple, high level, user functions,
and will in fact perform the largest chunk of User level services. These
Kernels will provide full emulation of Commercial and Freeware Operating
systems, As well as functional Server modules, and Scientific simulation
modules.

<P>Alliance Application Kernels are the core of what Alliance is.
These Kernels will provide full functionality of other Operating Systems
through the Alliance System. Each AEAK will be written in detail in a whitepaper.
Primarily, the Emulation will simply provide a necessary framework for
the applications of an operating system to function in our operating system
by translating the emulated OS' system calls no Alliance native ones.
<H3>
<A NAME="AGUI"></A>6.1. Alliance Graphical User Interface [<I>AGUI</I>]</H3>
Alliance Graphical User Interface will be the most commonly used AK, as
it will provide a fully functional GUI that is fully customizable to the
user's taste. This GUI will be capable of "autoloading" other AKs as needed
to emulate Operating System functionality. In this respect, all applications
loaded into the system will be "marked" in a database according to which
AK is required to load the application. When the application is called
by the user, the database will be checked for a
<BR>dependent AK, the AK will be checked, loaded if necessary, and then
the AGUI handle the calls to draw and handle Visual Objects (Windows, Buttons
and so on...), making the desktop uniform (instead of having different
windows depending on which AK draws them). If the application is a non-graphical
environment one, a window will be created and the output of the app will
be drawn there.

<P>This Kernel will be optional, other AKs can be loaded as the primary
GUI, such as Windows 95 explorer, if the user wanted a full screen Windows
95 session, providing still full emulation services via the UISK. Multiple
Full Screen OS sessions can be provided by providing Virtual consoles,
similar to un*x's.
