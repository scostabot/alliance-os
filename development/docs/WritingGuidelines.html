<H2> <A NAME="Introduction"></A>2. Introduction</H2>
Besides oral communication, written documents are the most important means
of communication. Written words are the ideal complement to spoken words:
the first fix in the eternity the (possibly) beautiful intuitions that
comes out from our mind. Digital documents are even more important, mostly
thanks to their ability to convey new capabilities to this basic medium.
Not only we can archive easily and effectevely informations, but we can
organize them in a deeply linked structure with <I>hyperlinks</I>. In any
project, and especially complex ones, there is no fix route to the knowledge:
each one follow a different path, depending on his/her experience. Hyperlinks
follow naturally human behaviour, and for this reason are chosen as a building
block of Alliance Project documents. This statement does not imply that
pure-ASCII document will not exist, but that <I>at least</I> HTML documents
will be used.

<A NAME="Document"></A>3. Document Structure</H2>
Except for casual readings, you cannot acquire knowledge without a structured,
hierarchical document layout. Alliance Project Document Guideline standardize
some form of paragraph name, order and context to emphasize this concept.
Paragraphs are <I>mandatory</I> if there presence is needed to make a document
compliant, <I>optional</I> is used instead to identify such paragraphs
that are not required to be present, leaving to the author the choice.
The paragraph order though, must be preserved, even for optional items.
<H3>
Title (mandatory)</H3>
The official name for the document, with release number. Must be centered
in the page.
<H3>
Author (mandatory)</H3>
The name(s) of the document writer(s). If possible, include e-mail address
as well. One name for row, centered in the page.
<H3>
Index (mandatory)</H3>
The chapters and paragraphs titles. In HTML documents all entries are links
within the document.
<H3>
Abstract (mandatory)</H3>
This is a very small paragraph that contains a brief, high-level description
of what will be described more precisely in following sections. If the
document describes an entity identified by an acronym, that must be cited
and spelled fully (e.g. "This document describes International Standard
Organization ISO-8851..").
<H3>
Introduction (mandatory)</H3>
If the subject requires some premises in order to be understood fully,
here is the place to do so. Even if the subject is so well kmown to deserve
such practice, a quick report on the actual expertise and situation of
the field is required.
<H3>
The actual document work (mandatory)</H3>
Here is contained the ideas behind the document. Try to be as clear as
possible. There is no limit on the substructure of this paragraph, size
and content.
<H3>
Acknowledgments (optional)</H3>
This is the place to put all kind of acknowledgemets, if any.
<H3>
References (optional)</H3>
If your work is relates to other sources (papers, books, videos, magazines,
URLs...) this is the place where to list them. Each item must have a brief
description. In HTML documents references to URLs can be inlined directly
in the text, but put a note here also, expecially for lengthy documents.
<H3>
History (mandatory)</H3>
Put here the history of changes that has formed the actual document. Each
entry must contain the release number, date of change and a brief description
of what was changed from previous version.

<H2> <A NAME="Document Formatting"></A>4. Document Formatting</H2>
When first introducing a noun, or a word with a particular standardized
meaning, use <I>italics</I> where format chosen make it possible.
<BR>In HTML documents you can use any facility offered, providing that
the feature is used to <I>aid</I> the reader to understand better and not
to demonstrate some (in)abilities of the writer. Saying that, use of frames
is discouraged, as well blinking items and animated pictures.
<BR>Use graphics only to explain clearly relationships, dependancies and
other not so evident structurized content. Use of graphics solely for aesthetic
purposes is forbidden.
<p>In order to make document reading and browsing more confortable, each chapter
is separated from the following with an horizontal line and a link to the top of
the HTML document as follows:<p>

<div align=right><i><a href="#Top">[Top]</a></i></div>

<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p>Acting this way is both handy in lengthy documents and less confusing.
