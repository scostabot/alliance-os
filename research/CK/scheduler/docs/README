This is the simulation of the Alliance Cache Kernel's scheduler, used for
research purposes.

In order to recompile the scheduler you will need to install Limes
(http://galeb.etf.bg.ac.yu/~dav0r/limes/).  Limes is used in order to make
the scheduler simlation realistic for multiprocessor systems, as well as
being a tool for simulating in general (it provides a clocking source, for
instance.)  As installing Limes is not a trivial matter (you need to
install a special version of GCC), I have also provided static binaries.

The static binary is called `sim', and can be found in the binaries/
directory.  In order to run the simulation, issue the following commands 
at your prompt:

# cd binaries
# ./sim > out

[press ctrl-c when you're tired of waiting.  the simulator runs forever]

You can now inspect the contents of the out file.
